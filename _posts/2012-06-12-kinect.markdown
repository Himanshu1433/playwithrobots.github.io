##[ Kinect](/robotics-pool/kinect)

[**Kinect**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) is a <span class="mw-redirect">motion sensing</span> input device by Microsoft for the Xbox 360 video game console and <span class="mw-redirect">Windows</span>PCs. The device features an RGB camera, depth sensor and multi-array microphone running proprietary software, which provide full-body 3D motion capture, facial recognition and voice recognition capabilities.

At the Blur gaming zone in Chennai, I saw there were lots of people playing games using Xbox360 console and kinect  . And I thought well we do have a Kinect at our lab (We were using it as a depth sensor in another project), and I also love gaming. All I had to do was to work out the interface between the Kinect and the game. After a few hours of interface processing and several experiments in the lab, the game was finally ready to be played without any help of a controller. 

Here is a video of me, playing a racing game using Kinect as gesture sensor. This was made while I was an intern in [RISE Lab](http://rise.cse.iitm.ac.in/wiki/index.php/RISE_Robotics_Group), [IITM.](http://www.iitm.ac.in/)

OS configuration: Ubuntu 11.10, ROS electric, Openni unstable v1.5.2.23, NITE unstable v1.5.2.21 and X11 libraries.

Game: - SuperTuxKart.

Want to play ? Try your luck with this [package](https://github.com/AbhishekMehta/tf_experiments "Package on Github ") in ROS. 

X11 libraries were used to generate fake keyboard events for controlling the game.
